# Ungraded Assignment - UML Sequence Diagram for Item Sharing

Make a sequence diagram that captures the interactions of objects in the item sharing app when a new item is added.

Your sequence diagram should contain the following classes:
  - AddItemActivity
  - ItemList
  - Dimensions
  - Item

And contain calls of the following methods:
  - onCreate()
  - loadItems()
  - saveItem()
  - Dimensions constructor
  - Item constructor
  - addItem()
  - saveItems()

Lastly, the activation of AddItemActivity should start with the call to onCreate().

Hint: you may need to use nested activations.
