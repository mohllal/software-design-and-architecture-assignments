# Ungraded Assignment - UML Class Diagram for Sharing App

Produce a UML class diagram from a given code base for an item sharing application.

In its current state, a user of the app the owner is able to record the items they own and wish to share.

The owner may view all of their items, their ***Available*** items, or their ***Borrowed*** items.

The owner may change the status of an item they own from Available to Borrowed and back.

When an itemâ€™s status is changed to Borrowed, the owner must enter the username of the borrower.

Construct a UML class diagram that captures all the classes and relationships in the code base. For each class you should document all attributes and methods:
  - MainActivity
  - SectionsPagerAdapter
  - ItemsFragment
  - AllItemsFragment
  - AvailableItemsFragment
  - BorrowedItemsFragment
  - AddItemActivity
  - EditItemActivity
  - ItemList
  - Item
  - ItemAdapter
  - Dimensions

You should also include any superclasses that the above classes inherit from. However, you are NOT required to document any methods or variables from these, only their names:
  - AppCompatActivity
  - FragmentPagerAdapter
  - ArrayAdapter<Item>
  - Fragment

Style guidelines for UML class diagram:
  - Superclasses should be drawn above subclasses
  - Whole things should be drawn to the left of the part
  - There should be few crossing edges
  - Boxes should not overlap other boxes or edges
  - Diagram should flow from top to bottom and left to right
