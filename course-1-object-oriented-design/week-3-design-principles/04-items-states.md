# Ungraded Assignment - UML State Diagram for Items

## Assignment Topic

- Remember that an item can either be ***Available*** or ***Borrowed*** and can either have an image attached or not.

- In this assignment you are to make a state diagram that captures the four possible states of an item.
  - Available without photo
  - Available with photo
  - Borrowed without photo
  - Borrowed with photo

- Include arrows to indicate transitions between the states and label these transitions accordingly. And, remember to include the terminal state and to indicate the starting state.
