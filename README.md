# Software Design and Architecture Notes

This repository contains my notes, and highlights for the [Coursera's Software Design and Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-design-architecture) offered by [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html).

In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, I learned how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. I also learned how to express and document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation.
